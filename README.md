# Roundabout Texting System

The aim for the 4 day sprint was to complete an MVP that would send text messages from a particular user. This would be used by keyworkers to engage with a young person. During the 4 day sprint, we were able to complete this task, and created a system using the API **Nexmo** that sent text messages.
